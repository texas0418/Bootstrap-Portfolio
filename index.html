                                                I was born in December of 1970 in San Antonio, Texas. My parents moved us to
                                                the Clear Lake part of Houston not long after I was born, where I spend most of
                                                my childhood. I quit school my freshman year of high school and got my GED the year
                                                after and ended up at a trade school in Waco, Texas, where I got an associate’s degree in
                                                computer maintenance.

                                                My work career is extensive and in different areas as I could not keep
                                                a job and moved around a lot. I worked as a computer technician, graphic designer, in
                                                restaurants, in bars, sales, and presently in the oil and gas industry. Recently I
                                                decided that my career path wasn’t one I wanted to continue to follow, so I decided to
                                                go back to school for coding and cybersecurity.

                                                I have many hobbies, but ultimately, I enjoy learned and building. The
                                                Raspberry Pi has opened up a whole new world of possibilities and I just completed my
                                                Smart Mirror build. I also make RetroPie gaming systems with the Pi board. My other
                                                hobbies include collecting comics; mostly graded and key issues. Building and modifying
                                                motorcycle; I am presently working on a cafe racer based on an old 1978 Honda CB750K
                                                frame. And one of my next projects is building a home server lab to help with getting
                                                my cybersecurity certification.
